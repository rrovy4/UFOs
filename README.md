Module 11

Overview of Project:
- Explore JavaScript functionalities
- Analyze data stored on js format
- Utilize and explore HTML, CSS, and JS functionalities when interlinked
- Create appealing frontend view and interactive backend functionalities to sort and display data

Results:
- Users get multiple choices to filter the data
- One or more fields can be updated by users and the relevant data would be displayed in the front end
- Example:
    ![img.png](static/images/img.png)

Summary:
- One drawback that I can think of for this design is there needs to be more try / except in the backend. This will ensure user input is in correct format and as expected.
- Recommendations for further development would be: (1) adding more data in the backend (2) Having data stored in a database for robustness
